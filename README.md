# Shadowfox-Intermediate-Task-01



• Developed an algorithm to calculate the Air Quality Index (AQI) for hourly pollutant values and assigned corresponding labels based on established guidelines.
• Constructed a predictive model using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to accurately forecast the AQI, leveraging insights gained from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and comprehensive dataset preprocessing techniques.
• Evaluated the performance of the predictive model on previously unseen data, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 82% and demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

</br>The majority of the data points have AQI's between 0 and 150 which means that the livability condition is between Good and Unhealthy for sensitive groups.

</br>The concentration of CO in the atmosphere is greater during the weekdays of winter and autumn as compared to the weekends in those seasons, because a lot less number of trains and cars are running on weekends to commute people to and from their work.
</br>Summer and Monsoon have similar concentrations of CO during the weekdays and the weekends.
</br>As compared to other seasons, Monsoons are rightly the least polluted ones which makes sense because a lot of pollution matter are washed away from the atmosphere, flowing away the rain into the ground.

</br>The air quality index reaches a peak during the 3:00 PM hour of the day. One of the primary reasons is the increased vehicular traffic till 3:00 PM and from then the Air quality index keeps reducing as there traffic go down.

</br>NO2 and SO2 are not directly related to CO. However, the presence of NO2 and SO2 in the air can indirectly affect the levels of CO in the atmosphere.
