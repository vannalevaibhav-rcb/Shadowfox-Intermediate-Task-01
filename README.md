# Shadowfox-Intermediate-Task-01
• Developed an algorithm to calculate the Air Quality Index (AQI) for hourly pollutant values and assigned corresponding labels based on established guidelines.
• Constructed a predictive model using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to accurately forecast the AQI, leveraging insights gained from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and comprehensive dataset preprocessing techniques.
• Evaluated the performance of the predictive model on previously unseen data, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 82% and demonstrating its robustness and reliability.
